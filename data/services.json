      "description": "Vita Health Group delivers the NHS Talking Therapies service (formerly IAPT) for West Essex. This service represents a significant shift towards patient autonomy through its \"self-referral\" model.\n\nEligibility: The service is open to anyone aged 16+ registered with a GP in Harlow, Uttlesford, or Epping Forest.   \n\nReferral Pathways: The traditional barrier of requiring a GP referral has been removed. Patients can refer themselves via:\n\nTelephone: A direct line (0333 015 2966) operates with extended hours (Mon–Thurs 8am–8pm, Fri 9am–5pm) to accommodate working adults.   \n\nDigital Assistant: An automated tool named \"Limbic\" on their website guides users through a clinical assessment to streamline intake.   \n\nPhysical Drop-in: To bridge the digital divide, a drop-in service is hosted at Harlow Library on the last Tuesday of every month (12:30 pm – 2:30 pm). This ensures that those without digital access or confidence can still enter the therapeutic pathway.   \n\nInterventions: The service offers a broad clinical menu, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), Counselling for Depression, and specialized pathways for those whose mental health is impacted by long-term physical conditions.
