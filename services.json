This ensures that those without digital access or confidence can still enter the therapeutic pathway.   \n\nInterventions: The service offers a broad clinical menu, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), Counselling for Depression, and specialized pathways for those whose mental health is impacted by long-term physical conditions.
